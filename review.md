Strengths:

* The paper clearly lays out all the prerequisites needed to understand the
implementation, making it accessible to initiated members of the computer
science community
* The paper does not assume any knowledge of quantum mechanics, focusing on
the critical quantum error correction algorithms, and the analysis thereof
* Crucially, the paper offers an open-source implementation, offering members
of the community the opportunity to quickly validate and expand upon the work.


Limitations:

* The paper is very mathematics-heavy. There are several formulae, such as those
on pages 12 and 13, which intermix calligraphic and italicized versions of the
same character
* The paper introduces some definitions out of order of dependence, making the
paper less accessbile to some newcomers.
* While its omission is warranted by the generous provision of an open-source
library, a concise description of the new algorithm is absent.
